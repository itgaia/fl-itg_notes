# ITGaia Notes Flutter app

This is a Flutter project for handling the "notes".
Notes are small or big pieces of text about something that we want to keep them handy.
It could be the sticker notes or bigger text portions (from a book, magazine, article, link, etc)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that follows the
[bloc state management](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple) and 
[clean architecture](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple).

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
